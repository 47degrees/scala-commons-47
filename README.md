# Scala Commons 47 (ARCHIVED)

## ScalaZ Monad Utils

This repository defines an heterogeneous collection of Scala related utils, traits and classes, to ease the use of the ScalaZ library.

### OptionTFutureConversion

Allows mixing heterogeneous expressions in for comprehensions without the need for nested flatmaps or nested for - yield.
Uses Scalaz ```OptionT``` to resolve ```Future[Option]``` expressions into their flattened values.

Consider a case where you have the need to pass values from functions with heterogeneous result types and that are somewhat chained or dependent in a list of operations.

```scala

def fetchSample1: Future[Option[Int]] = ???

def fetchSample2(sample1: Int): Future[Option[Int]] = ???

def compute(a: Int, b: Int): Option[Int] = ???

def anotherAsyncComputation(previousComputation: Int): Future[Int] = ???

```

In plain Scala you may chain nested flatMap calls to keep the types compatible...

```scala

def plainScalaImpl: Future[Option[Int]] = fetchSample1 flatMap {
    case Some(sample1) => fetchSample2(sample1) flatMap {
      case Some(sample2) =>
        compute(sample1, sample2) match {
          case Some(previousComputation) => anotherAsyncComputation(previousComputation) map (Option(_))
          case _ => Future.successful(None)
        }
    }
}

```

Alternatively with Scalaz OptionT monad transformer and some boilerplate you can keep the types compatible in
a single for comprehension like so...

```scala

import scalaz._
import scalaz.OptionT._

def optionTImpl: Future[Option[Int]] = (for {
    sample1 <- optionT(fetchSample1)
    sample2 <- optionT(fetchSample2(sample1))
    previousComputation <- optionT(Future.successful(compute(sample1, sample2)))
    finalResult <- optionT(anotherAsyncComputation(previousComputation) map (Option(_)))
  } yield finalResult).run

```

Finally with The OptionTFutureUtils you can further simplify it to

```scala

import com.fortysevendeg.commons.scala.utils.OptionTFutureConversion._

def optionTFutureUtils : Future[Option[Int]] = (for {
    sample1 <- ? <~ fetchSample1
    sample2 <- ? <~ fetchSample2(sample1)
    previousComputation <- ? <~ compute(sample1, sample2)
    finalResult <- ? <~  anotherAsyncComputation(previousComputation)
  } yield finalResult).run

```

Note type wrapping to Future[Option] is no longer necessary as the conversions are automatically provided for many common objects
such as Option, Future[A], A, etc...

This keeps for a nice and simpler operation chaining resulting in  the final Future[Option[A]]

- ```<*``` wraps any expression into an async Future(exp) then ```OptionT[Future, A]```
- ```<~``` wraps any expression into its ```OptionT[Future, A]```
- ```?``` is a an alias for ```optT```

# Install

Simply add the following dependency to your SBT based build

```scala

resolvers += "47deg Public" at "https://47degrees.bintray.com/snapshots"

libraryDependencies += "com.fortysevendeg" %% "scala-commons-47" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT" changing()

```
